Implemented A* Graph Search Algorithm in Python. 

<B>What is A* search Algorithm?</B>

A* Search Algorithm is a simple and efficient search algorithm that can be used to find the optimal path between two nodes in a graph. It will be used for the shortest path finding. It is an extension of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra’s Algorithm).
